Civilization is a final project for Principles of Programming and Computer Science class at Carnegie Mellon University. The game, 
which is inspired the 'Sid Meries Civilization' series, is a top-down turn-based strategy experience that tasks two players to build empires
and conquer each other's civilizations. Players construct settlements to harvest resources, build combat units, attack other units/settlements.

The game map is rendered in a isometric grid with pixeled graphics to achieve a semi-3D feel. It is composed of three different tile types--
forest, grass, and rock--that each have resources choosen from a pool of probabilities based on tile type. Food and production are the two
resources that can be harvested in the game and they are visually respresented by apple and gear icons respectively and are
overlayed over the tiles the are present in. For example a rock, which is a production heavy and food scarce tile, may have two gear icon 
displayed over its sprite but only 1 apple, thus implying a harvest would yield two production and one food.

Players begin the game with a settler unit, which can be moved by clicking the settler followed by the desired tile to settle. After 
positioning the settler, players can hover over it's location and press 'S' to create a settlement. 

In order to harvest resources, player must place a settlement and select tiles to harvest using their "population". A settlement's population
starts at two, thus limiting the player to two tiles to harvest. Tiles selected for harvest yield the resources shown over their sprite
every turn. Food contributes to increasing population, while production can be used to build more settlents and combat units to hinder
their opponent.

The game has three units: settlers, warriors, and spearmen. Settlers build settlements, warriors can plunder settlements and kill enemy units,
and spearmen are stronger, yet more costly versions of warriors.
